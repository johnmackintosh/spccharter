The goal of spccharter is rapid analysis of multiple statistical process control charts.
The package will create charts, detect signals of improvement, and revise control limits each time a signal occurs.
Currently, 'C', 'P' and 'U' charts can be produced. 

The package supports non standard evaluation - you can pass bare variable names.


## Installation

spccharter is not on [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) yet

*But* the development version is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes") # if not already installed
remotes::install_github("johnmackintosh/spccharter")
```
## Example

One grouping variable:

```{r example, eval=FALSE}
library(spccharter)
spccharter(data, numerator = counts, datecol = date, 
           by = category_1, plot_type = 'c', direction = "both")
```

Two grouping variables:  

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(spccharter)
spccharter(data, numerator = counts, denominator = attends, datecol = date, 
           by = c('ward','hospital'), plot_type = 'p', direction = "both")
```
